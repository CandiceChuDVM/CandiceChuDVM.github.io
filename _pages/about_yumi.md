Hi! I’m Yumi! My name might sound Japanese, but it’s actually a fun twist on my childhood Mandarin name—I’m from Taiwan! I earned my Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree from National Chung Hsing University, and I’m currently diving into the exciting worlds of pathology and artificial intelligence. I’m also a proud dog mom to a sweet, people-loving mixed-breed girl. When I’m not exploring science or chasing new ideas, you’ll find me in the kitchen, cooking up something delicious and fully enjoying the process from start to finish.
