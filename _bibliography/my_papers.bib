	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{ChatGPT}, the most accessible generative artificial intelligence ({AI}) tool, offers considerable potential for veterinary medicine, yet a dedicated review of its specific applications is lacking. This review concisely synthesizes the latest research and practical applications of {ChatGPT} within the clinical, educational, and research domains of veterinary medicine. It intends to provide specific guidance and actionable examples of how generative {AI} can be directly utilized by veterinary professionals without a programming background. For practitioners, {ChatGPT} can extract patient data, generate progress notes, and potentially assist in diagnosing complex cases. Veterinary educators can create custom {GPTs} for student support, while students can utilize {ChatGPT} for exam preparation. {ChatGPT} can aid in academic writing tasks in research, but veterinary publishers have set specific requirements for authors to follow. Despite its transformative potential, careful use is essential to avoid pitfalls like hallucination. This review addresses ethical considerations, provides learning resources, and offers tangible examples to guide responsible implementation. A table of key takeaways was provided to summarize this review. By highlighting potential benefits and limitations, this review equips veterinarians, educators, and researchers to harness the power of {ChatGPT} effectively.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Dogs with X-linked hereditary nephropathy ({XLHN}) have a glomerular basement membrane defect that leads to progressive juvenile-onset renal failure. Their disease is analogous to Alport syndrome in humans, and they also serve as a good model of progressive chronic kidney disease ({CKD}). However, the gene expression profile that affects progression in this disease has only been partially characterized. To help fill this gap, we used {RNA} sequencing to identify differentially expressed genes ({DEGs}), over-represented pathways, and upstream regulators that contribute to kidney disease progression. Total {RNA} from kidney biopsies was isolated at 3 clinical time points from 3 males with rapidly-progressing {CKD}, 3 males with slowly-progressing {CKD}, and 2 age-matched controls. We identified 70 {DEGs} by comparing rapid and slow groups at specific time points. Based on time course analysis, 1,947 {DEGs} were identified over the 3 time points revealing upregulation of inflammatory pathways: integrin signaling, T cell activation, and chemokine and cytokine signaling pathways. T cell infiltration was verified by immunohistochemistry. {TGF}-beta1 was identified as the primary upstream regulator. These results provide new insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms of disease progression in {XLHN}, and the identified {DEGs} can be potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets translatable to all {CKDs}.},

Using {mRNA} sequencing ({mRNA}-seq), we have characterized the gene expression profile affecting the progression of {XLHN}; however, the {microRNA} ({miRNA}, {miR}) expression remains unknown. With small {RNA}-seq and quantitative {RT}-{PCR} ({qRT}-{PCR}), we used 3 small {RNA}-seq analysis tools ({QIAGEN} {OmicSoft} Studio, {miRDeep}2, and {CPSS} 2.0) to profile differentially expressed renal {miRNAs}, top-ranked {miRNA} target genes, and enriched biological processes and pathways in {CKD} progression. Twenty-three kidney biopsies were collected from 5 dogs with {XLHN} and 4 age-matched, unaffected littermates at 3 clinical time points (T1: onset of proteinuria, T2: onset of azotemia, and T3: advanced azotemia). We identified up to 23 differentially expressed {miRNAs} at each clinical time point. Five {miRNAs} ({miR}-21, {miR}-146b, {miR}-802, {miR}-142, {miR}-147) were consistently upregulated in affected dogs. We identified {miR}-186 and {miR}-26b as effective reference {miRNAs} for {qRT}-{PCR}.

	abstract = {Post-acute sequelae of {COVID}-19 ({PASC}, "Long {COVID}") pose a significant global health challenge. The pathophysiology is unknown, and no effective treatments have been found to date. Several hypotheses have been formulated to explain the etiology of {PASC}, including viral persistence, chronic inflammation, hypercoagulability, and autonomic dysfunction. Here, we propose a mechanism that links all four hypotheses in a single pathway and provides actionable insights for therapeutic interventions. We find that {PASC} are associated with serotonin reduction. Viral infection and type I interferon-driven inflammation reduce serotonin through three mechanisms: diminished intestinal absorption of the serotonin precursor tryptophan; platelet hyperactivation and thrombocytopenia, which impacts serotonin storage; and enhanced {MAO}-mediated serotonin turnover. Peripheral serotonin reduction, in turn, impedes the activity of the vagus nerve and thereby impairs hippocampal responses and memory. These findings provide a possible explanation for neurocognitive symptoms associated with viral persistence in Long {COVID}, which may extend to other post-viral syndromes.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Small {RNA} sequencing ({RNA}-seq) of biofluids is challenging due to the relative scarcity of {microRNAs} ({miRNAs}), limited sample volumes, and the lack of a gold standard isolation method. Additionally, few comparisons exist for the {RNA} isolation and sequencing methods of biofluids. {OBJECTIVES}: We aimed to compare the performance of six commercial {RNA} isolation kits and two library preparation methods for small {RNA}-seq using canine serum and urine. {METHODS}: Serum and urine were collected from seven dogs with protein-losing nephropathy, and the samples were pooled. Total {RNA} from serum (2 {mL}) and urine (10 {mL}) was isolated in triplicate using three methods each for serum (Zymo Direct-zol, {mirVana} {PARIS}, {miRCURY} Biofluids) and urine (Qiagen {exoRNeasy}, Norgen Urine Exosome, {miRCURY} Exosome). For each sample type, the two kits yielding the highest {RNA} concentration were selected, and small {RNA}-seq was performed using {TruSeq} and {NEXTflex} library preparations. Data were analyzed by {CPSS} 2.0 and {DESeq}2. {RESULTS}: For serum, Zymo Direct-zol combined with {NEXTflex} was the only combination that enabled successful library preparation, while for urine, Qiagen {exoRNeasy} combined with {NEXTflex} outperformed other combinations for detecting {miRNAs}. The total number of {miRNAs} detected in serum and urine was 198 and up to 115, respectively. {miRNA} expression in serum was distinct from urine. Furthermore, the library preparation method introduced a higher variation of urine results than the {RNA} isolation method. {CONCLUSIONS}: Different isolation and library preparation methods show significant differences in {miRNA} results that could affect biomarker discovery. Small {RNA}-seq provides an unbiased, global assessment to compare these methods in canine biofluids.},

	abstract = {Duchenne muscular dystrophy ({DMD}) causes progressive disability in 1 of every 5,000 boys due to the lack of functional dystrophin protein. Despite much advancement in knowledge about {DMD} disease presentation and progression—attributable in part to studies using mouse and canine models of the disease–current {DMD} treatments are not equally effective in all patients. There remains, therefore, a need for translational animal models in which novel treatment targets can be identified and evaluated. Golden Retriever muscular dystrophy ({GRMD}) is a phenotypically and genetically homologous animal model of {DMD}. As with {DMD}, speed of disease progression in {GRMD} varies substantially. However, unlike {DMD}, all {GRMD} dogs possess the same causal mutation; therefore genetic modifiers of phenotypic variation are relatively easier to identify. Furthermore, the {GRMD} dogs used in this study reside within the same colony, reducing the confounding effects of environment on phenotypic variation. To detect modifiers of disease progression, we developed gene expression profiles using {RNA} sequencing for 9 dogs: 6 {GRMD} dogs (3 with faster-progressing and 3 with slower-progressing disease, based on quantitative, objective biomarkers) and 3 control dogs from the same colony. All dogs were evaluated at 2 time points: early disease onset (3 months of age) and the point at which {GRMD} stabilizes (6 months of age) using quantitative, objective biomarkers identified as robust against the effects of relatedness/inbreeding. Across all comparisons, the most differentially expressed genes fell into 3 categories: myogenesis/muscle regeneration, metabolism, and inflammation. Our findings are largely in concordance with {DMD} and mouse model studies, reinforcing the utility of {GRMD} as a translational model. Novel findings include the strong up-regulation of chitinase 3-like 1 ({CHI}3L1) in faster-progressing {GRMD} dogs, suggesting previously unexplored mechanisms underlie progression speed in {GRMD} and {DMD}. In summary, our findings support the utility of {RNA} sequencing for evaluating potential biomarkers of {GRMD} progression speed, and are valuable for identifying new avenues of exploration in {DMD} research.},
