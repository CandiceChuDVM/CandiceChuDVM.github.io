	abstract = {Dogs with X-linked hereditary nephropathy (XLHN) have a glomerular basement membrane defect that leads to progressive juvenile-onset renal failure. Their disease is analogous to Alport syndrome in humans, and they also serve as a good model of progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the gene expression profile that affects progression in this disease has only been partially characterized. To help fill this gap, we used RNA sequencing to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), over-represented pathways, and upstream regulators that contribute to kidney disease progression. Total RNA from kidney biopsies was isolated at 3 clinical time points from 3 males with rapidly-progressing CKD, 3 males with slowly-progressing CKD, and 2 age-matched controls. We identified 70 DEGs by comparing rapid and slow groups at specific time points. Based on time course analysis, 1,947 DEGs were identified over the 3 time points revealing upregulation of inflammatory pathways: integrin signaling, T cell activation, and chemokine and cytokine signaling pathways. T cell infiltration was verified by immunohistochemistry. TGF-beta1 was identified as the primary upstream regulator. These results provide new insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms of disease progression in XLHN, and the identified DEGs can be potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets translatable to all CKDs.},

	abstract = {Dogs with X-linked hereditary nephropathy (XLHN) are an animal model for Alport syndrome in humans and progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD). Using mRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq), we have characterized the gene expression profile affecting the progression of XLHN; however, the microRNA (miRNA, miR) expression remains unknown. With small RNA-seq and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), we used 3 small RNA-seq analysis tools (QIAGEN OmicSoft Studio, miRDeep2, and CPSS 2.0) to profile differentially expressed renal miRNAs, top-ranked miRNA target genes, and enriched biological processes and pathways in CKD progression. Twenty-three kidney biopsies were collected from 5 dogs with XLHN and 4 age-matched, unaffected littermates at 3 clinical time points (T1: onset of proteinuria, T2: onset of azotemia, and T3: advanced azotemia). We identified up to 23 differentially expressed miRNAs at each clinical time point. Five miRNAs (miR-21, miR-146b, miR-802, miR-142, miR-147) were consistently upregulated in affected dogs. We identified miR-186 and miR-26b as effective reference miRNAs for qRT-PCR. This study applied small RNA-seq to identify differentially expressed miRNAs that might regulate critical pathways contributing to CKD progression in dogs with XLHN.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Small RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of biofluids is challenging due to the relative scarcity of microRNAs (miRNAs), limited sample volumes, and the lack of a gold standard isolation method. Additionally, few comparisons exist for the RNA isolation and sequencing methods of biofluids. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare the performance of six commercial RNA isolation kits and two library preparation methods for small RNA-seq using canine serum and urine. METHODS: Serum and urine were collected from seven dogs with protein-losing nephropathy, and the samples were pooled. Total RNA from serum (2 mL) and urine (10 mL) was isolated in triplicate using three methods each for serum (Zymo Direct-zol, mirVana PARIS, miRCURY Biofluids) and urine (Qiagen exoRNeasy, Norgen Urine Exosome, miRCURY Exosome). For each sample type, the two kits yielding the highest RNA concentration were selected, and small RNA-seq was performed using TruSeq and NEXTflex library preparations. Data were analyzed by CPSS 2.0 and DESeq2. RESULTS: For serum, Zymo Direct-zol combined with NEXTflex was the only combination that enabled successful library preparation, while for urine, Qiagen exoRNeasy combined with NEXTflex outperformed other combinations for detecting miRNAs. The total number of miRNAs detected in serum and urine was 198 and up to 115, respectively. miRNA expression in serum was distinct from urine. Furthermore, the library preparation method introduced a higher variation of urine results than the RNA isolation method. CONCLUSIONS: Different isolation and library preparation methods show significant differences in miRNA results that could affect biomarker discovery. Small RNA-seq provides an unbiased, global assessment to compare these methods in canine biofluids.},
